1. Variable 1: No_of_times_Pregnant
From the distribution(pdfs-var1_histogram,var1_barplot) we can say that the distribution is most likely right-skewed.
 
   	Variable 2: Plasma glucose concentration
From the distribution(pdfs-var2_histogram,var2_barplot) we can say that the distribution is normal.

   	Variable 3: Diastolic blood pressure
From the distribution(pdfs-var3_histogram,var3_barplot) we can say that the distribution is mostly normal except for a few values.

	Variable 4: Triceps skin fold thickness
From the distribution(pdfs-var4_histogram,var4_barplot) we can say that the distribution is not normal

	Variable 5: 2-Hour serum insulin
From the distribution(pdfs-var5_histogram,var5_barplot) we can say that the distribution is not normal . It is most likely right-skewed.

	Variable 6: Body mass index
From the distribution(pdfs-var6_histogram,var6_barplot) we can say that the distribution is normal.

	Variable 7: Diabetes pedigree function
From the distribution(pdfs-var7_histogram,var7_barplot) we can say that the distribution is not-normal.(right-skewed)

	Variable 8: Age
From the distribution(pdfs-var8_histogram,var8_barplot) we can say that the distribution is not-normal(right-skewed).
