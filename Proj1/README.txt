Game of Craps

The file Craps.java contains the source code. The commands to run the file are 
Compile: javac Craps.java
run: 	java Craps

running the program will create a txt file named output.txt in the same directory from where the source code is run.

Strategy 1 worked best as the loss or gain after each round were neither too high/low. For some rounds the strategies 2 and 3 were giving either very good profits or high loss.
If the values from output.txt are considered: 
The mean of the ending balances for strategy 1 is (1400+600+1000+1000+1400)/5= 1080
The mean of the ending balances for strategy 2 is (1700+200+0+1400+1700)/5=1000
The mean of the ending balances for strategy 3 is (1400+300+500+500+1400)/5=820
